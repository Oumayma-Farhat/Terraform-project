# ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Devops pipline with Terraform, Github Actions and GitOps üöÄ

In this project, I built a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Python web application using modern DevOps tools and practices:

-  Provisioned a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube and Terraform.

- Containerized the application by writing a custom Dockerfile.

- Automated Docker image builds and pushes with GitHub Actions.

-Created a Helm chart to manage Kubernetes deployments.

- Implemented GitOps practices using ArgoCD for automated deployment and synchronization.

- Tested the pipeline end-to-end by triggering updates from source code changes.

Key Takeaways:
- Combine Terraform, Helm, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD to build a fully automated DevOps pipeline.
- Show how GitOps principles enable seamless synchronization between GitHub and Kubernetes.
